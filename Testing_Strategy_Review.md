# Testing Strategy Review

---

## Findings

- Existing tests:
  - `src/App.test.tsx` and some layout component tests.
  - Use **Vitest** and **React Testing Library**.
  - Only basic render checks, no behavior or logic tests.
- **No tests** for:
  - Zustand stores
  - Supabase integration
  - Business logic
  - User flows
- **No integration or end-to-end tests** found.

---

## Analysis

- Current tests provide **minimal smoke coverage**.
- Critical logic and flows are **untested**.
- No automated regression safety net.

---

## Recommendations

### Layered Testing Strategy

| Layer             | Purpose                                   | Tools                        | Status          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Unit Tests**    | Functions, stores                         | Vitest, Testing Library      | Minimal         |
| **Integration**   | Components + stores + API mocks           | Vitest, MSW                  | Missing         |
| **End-to-End**    | Full user flows in browser                | Playwright or Cypress        | Missing         |

### Priorities

1. **Unit tests** for Zustand stores, utilities.
2. **Integration tests** for key pages (Login, Dashboard, Project Detail).
3. **E2E tests** for critical flows (login, CRUD, role-based access).

### Setup

- Use **Vitest** for unit/integration.
- Use **Playwright** or **Cypress** for E2E.
- Integrate tests into CI pipeline.

### Approach

- Start with new features.
- Add tests for critical existing features.
- Expand coverage gradually.

## Summary

Implementing a layered testing strategy will improve reliability, catch regressions early, and support safer development.
