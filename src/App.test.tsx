// For a simple render test, often just rendering is enough if components handle missing context gracefully.
// However, App uses BrowserRouter, so wrapping in MemoryRouter for testing is better practice.

    // We can add a basic assertion, e.g., checking for an element known to be on the Index page
    // This depends on the Index page content, let's assume it has a specific heading or text.
    // For now, just rendering without error is the goal.
    // Example assertion (needs adjustment based on actual Index content):
    // expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { name: /welcome/i })).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  // Add more tests here as needed, e.g., testing routing logic
