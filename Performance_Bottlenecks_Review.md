# Performance Bottlenecks Review

---

## Findings

- **Dashboard** and **ExecutiveReport**:
  - Fetch all projects and portfolios on mount.
  - Perform heavy client-side data processing (aggregations, filters, maps, reduces).
  - Render multiple complex charts and large tables.
  - No memoization (`useMemo`) for derived data.
  - No virtualization for long lists/tables.
- **ExecutiveReport**:
  - Calculates many aggregates on every render.
  - Maps and filters nested arrays (projects, risks).
  - Renders multiple charts and tables with potentially large datasets.

---

## Risks

- UI freezes or lag with large datasets.
- Unnecessary recalculations on every render.
- Slow initial load times.

---

## Recommendations

- **Memoize derived data** with `useMemo`.
- **Paginate or virtualize** large lists/tables (react-window, react-virtualized).
- **Lazy load** heavy components or charts.
- **Optimize data fetching**:
  - Fetch only necessary data.
  - Use server-side aggregations (Supabase views/functions).
- **Profile performance** using React DevTools and browser profiling.
- **Consider code splitting** for large pages.

## Summary

Optimizing data processing, rendering, and fetching will improve responsiveness and scalability, especially with growing datasets.
