# Documentation Gaps Review

---

## Findings

- `README.md` includes:
  - Overview, tech stack, setup, scripts.
  - **Placeholders** for architecture and contribution guidelines.
- Other docs exist but are **not linked or summarized**.
- Missing:
  - Developer onboarding guide.
  - API documentation.
  - Data model diagrams.
  - Security policies and RLS documentation.
  - Testing instructions.
  - Environment-specific configuration guidance.

---

## Recommendations

### Update `README.md`

- Add high-level architecture summary with link to `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Add contribution guidelines (branching, code style, testing).
- Link to other key docs (roadmaps, analysis reports).

### Create or Update

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: diagrams, data flow, backend integration, RLS overview.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: detailed contribution process.
- `SECURITY.md`: RLS policies, demo account policy, secrets management.
- API documentation: REST endpoints, Supabase functions.
- Data model diagrams (ERD).
- Testing guide: how to run tests, coverage goals.

### Additional

- Automate documentation generation where possible.
- Keep documentation versioned and updated with code changes.

## Summary

Improving documentation will enhance onboarding, security, maintainability, and collaboration.
